## Regarding the addition of a GUI, new features, and current status.
Until I have a UI working for all platforms, I will not be adding a true customizable UI. imgui and others have been tested, but ive yet to get something working on macOS and Linux. Current focus is to fix the [bad codebase](https://gist.github.com/TerraHax/1def264cc6751eaf79e6266d0c79ec10) that TerraHax is comprised of, being over 7-8 years old. All functions of the client are currently in Maintenance mode. This means that additional functionality will not arrive until the complete rewrite is finished if ever. Some outstanding issues will be fixed, though. For example, .track is being worked on now as well as adding fishing power commands. In the meantime, I will continue to update this client as the game updates. The 2.0 release will be totally different and open source, so that everyone can stop giving me upset messages about not providing source code. Though, i will NOT however, provide the decompiled source code for the game. When 2.0 is released, it will more than likely only have IL patches or diffs available to the community.

As always, I hope you enjoy the client for what it is in its current state. If not, im sure someone else will make something great!
